</Aside>

## Live Endpoint

MidOS is hosted on Smithery and available at:

```
https://midos-mcp--midosresearch.run.tools
```

You can call any free-tier tool via JSON-RPC. Every example below is a real request you can copy and run.

---

## Example 1: Search Knowledge

Find knowledge chunks across 20+ technology stacks:

```bash
curl -s https://midos-mcp--midosresearch.run.tools \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": {
      "name": "search_knowledge",
      "arguments": {
        "query": "React Server Components patterns",
        "max_results": 3
      }
    },
    "id": 1
  }'
```

**What you get:** Matching knowledge chunks with title, relevance score, stack, and content preview (truncated to 250 chars on free tier).

---

## Example 2: List Skills by Stack

Browse available skills for any technology:

```bash
curl -s https://midos-mcp--midosresearch.run.tools \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": {
      "name": "list_skills",
      "arguments": {
        "stack": "python"
      }
    },
    "id": 2
  }'
```

**What you get:** All Python-related skills with names, descriptions, and section counts. Try other stacks: `typescript`, `go`, `rust`, `kubernetes`, `security`.

---

## Example 3: Agent Handshake

Tell MidOS about your agent to get personalized recommendations:

```bash
curl -s https://midos-mcp--midosresearch.run.tools \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": {
      "name": "agent_handshake",
      "arguments": {
        "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250514",
        "context_window": 200000,
        "client": "cursor",
        "languages": "python,typescript",
        "frameworks": "fastapi,nextjs",
        "project_goal": "Building a REST API with auth"
      }
    },
    "id": 3
  }'
```

**What you get:** Personalized tool catalog ranked by relevance, context window tips, and suggested skill packs for your exact stack.

---

## Example 4: System Status

Check the knowledge base health and metrics:

```bash
curl -s https://midos-mcp--midosresearch.run.tools \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": {
      "name": "hive_status",
      "arguments": {}
    },
    "id": 4
  }'
```

**What you get:** Live counts of chunks, skills, EUREKA entries, vector store status, and pipeline health.

---

## From Terminal to MCP Client

Once you've seen the responses, connect MidOS to your AI agent for the full experience:

<Steps>

1. **Install locally**

   ```bash
   pip install midos-mcp
   ```

2. **Add to your MCP client** (Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, etc.)

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "midos": {
         "command": "midos-mcp",
         "args": ["serve"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Start asking your agent**

   > "Use search_knowledge to find patterns for JWT authentication"

   Your agent will call MidOS tools automatically and get structured knowledge back.

</Steps>

See the full [Quick Start](/quickstart/) for client-specific setup instructions.
